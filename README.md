### Debugging Report: Player Image Not Showing

**Date:** May 8, 2025  
**Component Affected:** <Player />  
**Issue Summary:**  
Achraf Hakimi’s card image was broken due to an invalid image URL.

**Tools Used:**

- Chrome v124
- React Developer Tools
- React v18 (local setup via Create React App)

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. Opened React Developer Tools and inspected <PlayersList /> → <Player />.
2. Found that `imageUrl` for Hakimi pointed to a broken link.
3. Confirmed URL gave a 404 error when opened directly.

**Fix Applied:**

- Updated `players.js` with a valid image URL:
  ```js
  imageUrl: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Achraf_Hakimi_2024.jpg/640px-Achraf_Hakimi_2024.jpg";
  ```
